Tool Definition
=========================

Used for adding new tools to framework.

Type of tools:

- Tools with predefined commands.
- Tools with custom command execution function.
- Tools which are built with Python
- Tools which do stuff without a binary


Notes:

- Tool should import utilities of the framework for easy implementation.
- Tool should use pyTest test function naming convention for pytest to find.
- Tool should have pytest marking defined for flexible execution.
- Tool should have asserting for process tracking.

Thanks to people those who build these small, cute pentest tools so that we can compine them.
